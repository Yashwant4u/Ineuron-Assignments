What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n*)Machine Learning is about finding out the optimal parameter in the equation in the given data set is called as machine learning\n\n\n2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n*)gmail,chatbot,predictions,fraud detection\n\n\n\n3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n*)Labeled training set is the data set where input and output data is fixed that is known values.It works on the predefined library train test split \n\n\n\n4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n*)Regression\n*)Classification\n\n\n\n5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n*)Customer segmentation   *)Rating  *)dimensionality reduction *)association rule mining\n\n\n\n6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n*)Reinforcement learning\n\n\n\n7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n*)Clustering\n\n\n\n8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n*)Supervised\n\n\n\n9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n*)Online learning system is something where we used to learn online without any teachers physically and best example is ineuron\n\n\n10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n*)Out-of-core learning is used when a dataset is too large to fit into a computer's memory. The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step, then repeats the process until it has run on all the data\n\n\n11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\nLinear regression\n\n\n\n12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\nModel parameters are the parameters which are estimated during the model training and hyper parameters are those which are set manually\n\n\n\n13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\nModel based learning algorithms look for the relation in the data and most popular method is linear regression and it used for predictions as well\n\n\n\n14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n*)Feature selection\n*)Feature Extraction\n*)Removing outliers\n*)Removing Noise\n\n\n\n15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n*)Need to remove outliers\n*)Need to remove features\n*)Multi colinearity\nIt is nothing but overfitting\n*)Gather more data\n\n\n\n16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n*)We need test set   to check the accuracy of our model where error should be less than the training data \n\n\n\n17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n*)Validation test purpose is that if we have generalization error more on production but where there is less error on test set during our model test.so here we will use validation test with various hyper parameter tuning values and will select the best one which gives less error on validation data set.so we will use validation data to reduce the error on production level\n\n\n\n18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n*)Training kit is something where we are using to find the best parameters and then selecting our model together.\n*)Dev kit is something where we are going to split the data at first and it used to identify to tell which is best model\n*)we need train-dev kit  when we want to select the best parameter and best model out of all remaining models\n*)we can put it to use at first like get the parameters from training and then use those on dev kit and then later check on test data\n\n\n\n19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\nIf we use hyperparameters on test set then generalization error will be more on production level like it gives problem on production level\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"hello\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"c6ae8324-da10-4508-b1ff-b7d720910634"}]}
