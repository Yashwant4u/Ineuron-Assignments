    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "  *A function is something where we include our code to perform a certain task where as function call is something where to perform a task where our code is written then we will call a function call to execute our task\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "*There are two scopes global and local\n",
    "=>global  scope means if we define a variable as global x(syntax) then x variable can be accessed from any place (inside or outside the function)\n",
    "=>Local scope means if we define a variable as x=10(syntax) then x variable can be accessed from inside  the function.outside the function we canâ€™t able to access and cannot change any values.\n",

    "==>=>local scope variables are destroyed once function call completes and again if we need it we need to call again\n",

    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "=>return value will come in function at the end it returns the values of which we keep and after return if we include any statements then it will not return any statements.\n",
    "yes we can return a value in an expression but it should be in return statement only\n",
